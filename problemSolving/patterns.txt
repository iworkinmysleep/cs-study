Frequency counter
-Uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
-Comparing two sets or more than two sets of data
ex.  Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.  The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array.  The frequency of values must be the same.  
same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) // true
same([1,2,3], [1,9]) // false
same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) // false (must be same frequency)
-finding anagrams with this method is also very useful

Multiple pointers
-Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition.
ex.  Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers.  The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0.  Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]) // [-3, 3]
sumZero([-2, 0, 1, 3]) // undefined
sumZero([1, 2, 3]) // undefined
