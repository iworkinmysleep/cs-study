Big O shorthands
*note big O measures the number of operations that happen 

Time complexity
1. Arithmetic operations are constant
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object(by key) is constant
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop.


Space complexity
- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
- Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
- Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
